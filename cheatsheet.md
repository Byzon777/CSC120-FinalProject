It's a game - The Wizard's Journey - and it takes players on a quest through some of locations within the Wizarding world - such as Hogwarts, Diagon Alley, and the Forbidden Forest. The narrative of the game will follow the player as he or she searches for all of the hidden artifacts and helps Harry Potter to win the war with Lord Voldemort. 
The game has 7 artefacts that hero (you) need to collect in order to win, each of them is hidden in different location. 
# The only 2 requirements for winning right now are - collect all 7 artefacts and keep health > 0. 
Game has 10 locations, each interconnect with each other - please look at the Map also in this repository to understand where locations realtive to each other. 
Spoiler: only 3 locations without artefact are - Forbidden Forest, Diagon Alley and Great Hall - all other have the required 7 artefacts to win. 
You can't collect artefact twice as they are get delected from the map immediately after to take them. In this version, you can run away from your enemies, but for the future improvement, it can be amended to make player immeadiately loose health if first command was not spell. 


Game rules and commands:
1. Explore the world by using commands like go + direction (e.g. "go east"). Game won't proceed without direction.
2. Collect artefacts by using "take artefact". FYI, you can say "take + any word" because I decided not to complicate game with exact name of artefacts 
3. Fight enemies using spells (e.g., 'spell Stupefy'). Don't write just spell it won't work. IMPORTANT: spelling is crucial when writing name of the spell. Game won't accept incorrect ones - it will just count as incorrect
Available Spells (for now): Stupefy, Expelliarmus, Lumos, Confringo, Reducto.
4. Use "status" to check your health and inventory. Number of artefacts collected as well as spells. 
5. If you do not cast a right spell when encountering an enemy, you will lose health. 
6. Use "quit" to end the game.
7. Use "help" to read the rules once again during the game.
